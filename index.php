					Women's Smart Defense Movement (WSDM)</div>
				
					<div class="marginlr10">	
						
						Self-defense techniques designed by men often make assumptions for women, resulting in gender-biased solutions that aren’t as applicable beyond combative sports. Women’s Smart Defense Movement is a living collection of practical, style-agnostic techniques that factor in women’s psychology and behavior during sexual assault or attack situations.  
	
						<p>
						WSDM prepares women to walk with confidence.
